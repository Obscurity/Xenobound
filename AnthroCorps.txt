ANTHRO CORPS

ORIGINS

"We must work to preserve humanity."

The Anthro Corps, originally formed by American and Canadian dissidents, was established in the wake of the social collapse of the 21st century.

Initially posturing itself as the only organization left that still cared about humanity over profits, it transcended its early roots and absorbed more and more of the functions previously relegated to government. Its popularity ensured that people turned away from their former rulers, embracing the Anthro Corps philosophy instead.

NOW

"If humanity must be preserved, then only force is adequate to the purpose."

As global warming and widespread panic ravaged the Earth, the Anthro Corps responded with military force, ultimately employing ruthless tactics to save what was left of humanity and manage it into useful groups. Ultimately, they deemed extreme measures necessary: the modern Anthro Corps is a multiglobal, totalitarian organization, owning Earth, Mars, a number of space stations, and all resources residing upon them.

RESOURCES AND LIFE

"Food, water, housing, and love - these are human rights."

Every human is bound under Anthro Corps contract to perform the labor dictated by the corporation in exchange for food, water, and housing. Children undergo apprenticeship to an elder worker as the sum total of their education, and then are assigned to a posting and a partner. All excess resources remain owned by the Anthro Corps.

The Anthro Corps respects gender, sexual orientation, and monogamous and polyamorous preference when it assigns pairings, and its algorithms generally result in practical matches which make their members very happy. In the case of relationships that are reproductive, babies are taken at birth and raised in an AnthroCorp creche, which are scientifically perfected to help children maximize their potential value to the Anthro Corps.

RELIGION AND POLITICS

"Humanity has abolished God, and with Him, the unending tyranny of the mind."

The Anthro Corps views religion as subordinate to organizational ideology, which emphasizes the subordination of humans to the greater cause of humanity. Respect for authority and for scientific knowledge is paramount in the Anthro Corps worldview, and the whole of the universe and its resources are explicitly recognized to be owned by Anthro Corps.

This makes religion, as well as less authoritarian political ideologies, problematic stances to hold and publicly express.

In spite of this, religious belief and political differences have endured, growing up from the cracks, defying the near-total surveillance under which all of humanity labors. It is not uncommon to witness humans publicly executed for the crime of opposition - the Anthro Corps universal contract contains a non-competition clause that applies to ideas as well as counter-economics.

CENSORSHIP

"The universe is full of precious resources, but none more precious than the knowledge of what is precious."

Censorship is pervasive within the Anthro Corps. Although the sum total of human knowledge remains existent, its full scope is limited to the upper leadership of the Corps, with knowledge assigned to workers on a need-to-know basis. Few texts exist outside of manuals and operating procedure; most fiction is children's stories, due to the fact that most preexisting literature is unacceptably subversive.

In the wake of this, a robust folk tradition has arisen, with stories, knowledge, and songs passed on largely by word of mouth.

PUNISHMENT

"There is the Anthro Corps, or there is destruction. There is no alternative."

The Anthro Corps is unforgiving and harsh in cases where people stand in violation of their contracts. A constant stream of criminals fuels the work camps, where prisoners perform whatever hard physical labor has not yet been automated. In more extreme cases, exile and execution are the methods of choice.
